On October 2, 2006, Netflix started the Netflix Prize Competition which gave prominence to
recommendation systems that are widely used by almost all tech and e-commerce giants today.
These systems generate a list of recommended products that users will most likely consume or
purchase. The algorithm works in 2 different ways – collaborative filtering, that uses community
preferences for recommendations, and content-based filtering, that matches user characteristics
to product attributes. With the help of the models created, we were able to establish the following
conclusions:
● Recommendation engines rely on historical data. Hence, no recommendations can be
made for new users or new products in the system – a classic cold start problem that
recommendation engines face.
● As a rule of thumb, new users can be directed to top-rated or trending movies until such
time that the system has enough data to provide them with a set of customized
recommended items.
● New users can be asked to rate a few products from the catalog at the time of acquisition.
● A set of trusted sources should be established for accessing new users’ data or ratings of
new products.
● Collect and utilize content-based information to include new products in
recommendations.
● Recommend the new product to a random set of customers and track preferences to
identify the group that responds best.
Several techniques can be used to predict user behavior, each more sophisticated than the
previous one. The primary challenge here isn’t developing a recommendation engine, but
instead, implementing them in an environment that enables these algorithms to perform at their
best capacity
